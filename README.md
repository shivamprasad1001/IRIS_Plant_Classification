# Iris Plant Classification

Welcome to the Iris Plant Classification project! This project aims to classify iris plants into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica, using multinomial classification algorithms.


## Introduction

The Iris Plant Classification project utilizes the famous Iris dataset to build and evaluate multinomial classification models for species classification. The dataset contains 150 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica), with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains:

- 150 samples
- 4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- 3 classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are displayed in a tabular format, allowing for easy comparison of the models.

Example results:

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Multinomial Logistic Regression | 0.97     | 0.96      | 0.97   | 0.96     |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | 0.95     | 0.94      | 0.95   | 0.94     |
| Decision Tree          | 0.94     | 0.93      | 0.94   | 0.93     |
| Random Forest          | 0.96     | 0.95      | 0.96   | 0.95     |
| SVM                    | 0.97     | 0.96      | 0.97   | 0.96     |
